# Structured-Credit-Analysis

This was a project I worked on in 2018 when I was investing in the equity tranche of consumer loan-backed securities. I implemented the method proposed by David Li (2000) to estimate the probability ditribution of default times and prepayment times of consumer loans. Using the Survival Analysis algorithm, I modelled the defaults and prepayments as the terminaiton of a loan's surviving process. We can use hazard rate function to predict the default probability at each time point of each loan, then use Copula method to model the correlation among loans.
